<h2>Script for QCRI/MIT CIMBA Demo (March 2014)</h2>

<h3>1. Alice signs up on cimba.co</h3>

<p>She uses some webid/storage provider</p>

<h3>2. Alice posts "Hello, World!"</h3>

<h3>3. Alice invites Bob to join and follow her</h3>

<p>How?  Does the system help her, or just write her own email?</p>

<h3>4. Bob signs up on cimba.co</h3>

<p>On a whim, he tries a different webid/storage provider.</p>

<h3>5. Bob sees Alice's post.</h3>

<p>Does he navigate to it, or does the invitation help get him here?</p>

<h3>6. Bob follows Alice</h3>

<h3>7. Alice is notified that Bob is follower her</h3>

<p>UI design: if she's on cimba.co, the screen updates in place.    Should she also get an email?</p>

<p>Underneath, what's the protocol?</p>

<h3>8. Alice posts "Welcome to my first follower"</h3>

<h3>9. Bob is notified of Alice's new post</h3>

<p>UI design: if he's on cimba.co, the screen updates in place.    Should he also get an email?</p>
